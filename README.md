# Format of slides
The slides are presented in jupyter lab for C#. These are executable documents which aren't necessary to open for these course, and the final slides can be viewed on here after the lectures. Just open the .ipynb file in the tutorial folder (if something is showing weird use the button at the top right to open it in nbviewer). 

If you do want to run them yourselves the installation guide can be found here:

__This is not mandatory or necessary for this course, so only do this for your own interest and after you've completed the assignments!!__
